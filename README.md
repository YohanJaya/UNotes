UNotes – Smart Lecture Note Taking App

UNotes is a lightweight, fast, and distraction-free note-taking app built for students who want to take organized notes while listening to lectures, especially those who don’t own a tablet.
This project was created primarily for my own betterment designed around my workflow, my comfort, and my style of studying but it can help any undergraduate who needs a simple and efficient note assistant.
